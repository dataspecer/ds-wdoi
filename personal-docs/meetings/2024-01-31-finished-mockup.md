## Comments

- Fix naming of the slides
  - keep consistency
  - "final product" is a bad choise of words
- Pictures on the slides 
  - in iterations one could keep the general pictures on each slide
- The problem with my presentation is that it is missing the coding part
  - i need to add slides that emphasize the coding part, either before the iterations or after all
  - the idea is that i could do a big slide with everything and then do a path how we got there
  - i also think i could keep a guide map on each slide during iteration


## Proposals

- After the finish of the mock up we should do a testing
- We should try to do other methods of property surroundings in the classes then range/domain constraints.
  1. We should precompute usage on instances and do our recomendations based on usage statistics.
  2. We could provide a user with a new prompt to enter instance id which would then provide properties on the given instance.
