# Second meeting

What I want is to mainly discuss some semantic of the Wikidata model and how to interpret it inside Dataspecer.
Then, I wish to consult semantics of the search dialog.

## Model

- Some properties have a constraint such that it can be used only as a qualifier/reference.
- Some properties have that they can be used only on Lexemes, Forms and Senses, Property, MediaInfo, Items.
- Constraints
  - Allowed entity types constrait
  - allowed qualifiers
- Wikidata instance of and subclass of in hierarchy?
    - Can I make instance seem as a subclass -> parent?

## Query dialog when searching for the root

- What is the semantics?
  - Write text input + add properties -> what to return.
  - Add only properties?
  - I think I would put the instance somewhere else.

## Discussing dp.
