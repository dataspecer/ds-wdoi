# Third meeting

This meeting I presented the `wikidata-adapter` for the current data model of the Dataspecer.
The adapter was just a simple implementation that used sparql queries and php api of the Wikidata to query their services.

## Task to the next meeting.

I wanted to start developing the backend.
