# First meeting after project start

I want to mainly show UI design in the Figma tool and ask questions about it.

## UI

[here](https://www.figma.com/file/6iULJh0Hvm4cSu39WisXLq/ds-wdoi?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=euG11MLTby7Yaq23-1)


- Questions:
  - Root selection
     1. Should the detail of the classes show hierarchy information that the user could navigate or leave it as is?
     2. Would the browsing via graph be a good thing?
     3. Should there be properties while browsing or in detail?
  - Association selection
     1. Mainly which design seems to be the best?
     2. What properties to show and how to perceive it in the Dataspecer tool?
        - How should I approach inheritance of properties?
          - Should I display properties of parents as well or just the ones specifically for the selected class? 

## First development phase

- Can I start?
- Meeting with Stepan if still not agreed upon.
- What defines the final type of value of an attribute/association?
  - [URL Property](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2699)
