# Forth meeting

This meeting I did not have anything prepared in general.
But I managed to get some feed back to the server design.


# Server design

- What technology to use?
    - I should do typescript since it is easier for me and later we can rewrite it in something else.
    - The parallelisation can be done in different ways than just threads, so i should not worry about the design choise right now.
- Where to store the data?
  - I should try to put it inside memory and see how it goes.
- Where to include the search of instances in the architecture?
  - It seemed like a good idea to have the search as a separate service.

# Next meeting

- Present the progress and have a discussion about master thesis.
