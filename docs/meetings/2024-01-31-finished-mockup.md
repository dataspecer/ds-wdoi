## Comments

- Fix naming of the slides
  - keep consistency
  - "final product" is a bad choise of words
- Pictures on the slides 
  - in iterations one could keep the general pictures on each slide
- The problem with my presentation is that it is missing the coding part
  - i need to add slides that emphasize the coding part, either before the iterations or after all
  - the idea is that i could do a big slide with everything and then do a path how we got there
  - i also think i could keep a guide map on each slide during iteration


## Proposals

- after the finish of the mock up we should do a testing
- instace na vyhledavani 
- chci i property ktere nemaji domain a range
- tri moznosti
  - instance summary predpocitat
  - nebo to delat uz na frontendu
  - nebo na zaklade instanci
