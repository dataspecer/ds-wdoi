# Server v3

Adjusting recommendations based on instances.
This version is extension of the previous version.
The plan is to add an option to the user to display properties based on certain instances summary to include qualifiers and other properties.

1. I should provide a precomputed summary of properties on instances - that should include qualifiers
2. it should reate frontend where a user would input instances and based on those i would display the properties.
